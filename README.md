👋 Hi! I'm Emir, a 16-year-old enthusiast with a passion for coding, technology, computers, innovations, cats, chess, and humor. 🐱♟️

🌐 My English proficiency is at C1 level, thanks to which I had the opportunity to go to Portugal during the 7th grade through the Erasmus+ project.

🚀 I'm determined to become a future software engineer and I'm putting in every effort to achieve that goal.

🔍 Previously, I had to leave my previous Github account for various reasons, but now I'm excited to continue working on my projects on this Github profile.

🔮 Let's embrace the world of technology together and make amazing things happen! Feel free to explore my repositories and join me on this coding journey.
